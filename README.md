# Churn-recommender

1 ) What is the purpose of customer churn prediction?

In a customer churn predictor, the model's primary purpose is to identify customers who are likely to stop using a product or service (i.e., "churn") within a specific timeframe. By knowing this data, businesses can take proactive steps, such as targeted retention campaigns or offering special incentives, to prevent these customers from leaving. Customer churn refers to the process of losing customers or clients, typically measured as the percentage of customers who discontinue their relationship with a business during a given period.
